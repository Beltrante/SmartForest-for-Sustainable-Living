# SmartForest: A Smart Home Project

Smart Forest is a collaborative project developed by **Politecnico di Milano** and the energy provider **Edison**. The project aims to develop an application for an **interactive mirror** helping users to easily monitor their energy consumption and encourages them to use renewable energy sources.

The mirror displays an **interactive forest**, where users can earn leaves for using renewable energy and lose experience points, which is the lifespan of each tree, for using non-renewable energy. These leaves can then be used to purchase, plant, and upgrade trees in order to gain more and more leaves.

The mirror also provides real-time feedback and personalized recommendations for reducing energy consumption. Overall, Smart Forest hopes to engage users in an interactive and fun way to promote **sustainable energy practices** and raise awareness about the importance of renewable energy.
